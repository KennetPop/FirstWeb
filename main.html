          <p><strong>Toledo Organic Teas</strong> operates as a partnership. The owners are <strong>Amelia Lara</strong> and

          <p>Our organic drinks combat the rise in an unhealthy population. We have always aspired to be catalysts of change
            in making positive impacts on our environment, the world populace, and economy. Toledo Organic Teas originated
            over the summer of 2019 when as mothers, we wanted to keep our children engaged in positive activities;
            therefore, we involved them in harvesting, cleaning, drying, grinding, and packing teas. As Q’eqchi’ women, it
            has always been a part of our culture to grind our teas at home. We felt obligated to pass on this knowledge to
            the younger generation. Furthermore, we witnessed the need to support local farmers who were producing a surplus.
            Finally, our organic drinks combat the rise in an unhealthy population. We have always aspired to be catalysts
            of change in making positive impacts on our environment, the world populace, and economy. Toledo Organic Teas
            exists to "Celebrate health, planet, and tea."</p>
